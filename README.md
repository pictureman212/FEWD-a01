# Hello There
## Here's some stuff about me
*it's not that interesting*

My name is Tim. I am from a rust belt city outside of Chicago. The weather is bad, the air and water is bad. I was miserable there because I love the outdoors.

So, in November of 2018 I decided to move out to San Diego where I could be outside more and experience all the wonder that nature provides in the west.

_**My favorite places include:**_
* Joshua Tree
* La Jolla Marine Sanctuary
* Anza Borrego
* San Bernadino National Forest
* Sequoia National Park
